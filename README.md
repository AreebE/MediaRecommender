# Retro Recommend
This website is meant to recommend forms of media to a user after they answer certain questions like what 
genre or themes they would like to see. After some time, an AI generates some media that the user can look up and watch.

Some of the questions will vary depending on the medium. (For example, video games will ask for difficulty while movies
will ask for actors.)
